Currently looking for work as a software developer or data analyst!

I completed a BSc in Electronics Engineering in 2017, briefly worked as an electronics engineering assistant and then returned to my passion for music, working as a performing and recording instrumentalist, soundtrack writer, producer, and audio engineer.

In 2023, I picked up some freelance data analyst work (mostly creating royalties reports for musicians). I developed some basic Python skills through this work and moved on to working as a data annotator for a US based company, Data Annotation. This work involves rating and correcting AI chatbots on a range of data science and math topics including Python programming and web dev with React, which has really helped develop my coding skills.

All repos starting with DA are from my study at Dev Academy Aotearoa.
